            <h3>Illustration of a black hole</h3>
            <p>The main boundary of a black hole is the <em>Event Horizon</em>, where nothing, not even light, can escape. The velocity 
                an object needs to escape the Event Horizon exceeds the speed limit of the universe, which is light speed. Black holes can get gas
            from other stars, which it then spins into a disk shape around the Horizon, called the accretion disk.
            As the gas and matter spins around the Event Horizon, it gets closer and closer to the center until
            it falls in. If you were to look at a black hole, you'll see colours, mainly bright blues and dark reds. The side of the accretion disk 
            that spins toward us is bright and blue, while the side that is away from us is dimmer and red; this is called Doppler Beaming, 
            or the Doppler Effect that we observe with, for example, sound. Sometimes, when matter is near the black hole, it turns into 
            powerful jets that go away from the black hole, reaching lengths of about hundreds of thousands of light years.</p>
            <h2>Real Photos</h2>
            <img src="Images/Real%20black%20hole.webp" alt="first real image of a black hole" style="width:550px;height;auto:">
            <h3>First real Image of a black hole</h3>
            <p>The first real image of a black hole was taken in early 2019. Using the <em>Event Horizon Telescope</em>, it captures the photo
            of a black hole located at the center of the galaxy M87, about 55 million light years from Earth. In this photo, we can clearly see the 
            Doppler Beaming effect, with one side of the accretion disk looking brighter than the one facing away from us. The most famous photo of a black hole
                is also the hardest photo to take. It was unimaginably far away, and black holes warp the space around them; a normal telescope cannot
            see them. So, a special telescope with the right capabilities was made to find one and take a picture of it.</p>
