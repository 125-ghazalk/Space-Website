            <h3>The Pleiades and Orion the Hunter</h3>
            <p>The most famous constellation is Orion, an ancient Greek 
            mythological figure. His most defining feature is his belt, made up of
                3 stars together closely in a line. Orion chases the <em>Pleiades</em>, which are a star cluster
            and in mythology, a group of women turned into stars by the god Zeus to escape Orion The Hunter. They are class B stars, which are the 
                second hottest, brightest, and have a lot of energy.

            <h3>Ursa Major</h3>
            <p>Ursa Major is one of the most well known constellations in the world. Another name for it is the <em>Great Bear</em> and we have known about 
            this constellation since 2,000 years ago, although it didn't have a name yet. Well known and prominent constellations
            like Ursa Major have helped humans navigate directions for thousands of years as they are a constant in our sky. </p>

            <h3>Hertzprung-Russel Diagram</h3>
            <p>A Hertzprung-Russel diagram is a way to visualize how stars are classified. Most stars, including our Sun, are <em>Main Sequence</em> stars. Main Sequence stars 
                are the most common type, and make up about 90% of all stars. these stars spend most of their lifetime in as a Main 
            Sequence star, but the specific amount of time spent is based on its mass. High mass stars, instead of dying out like other 
            stars, go through 3 other stages. Supergiant stars, once they become really hot, go through nuclear fusion in its core, 
            until the element iron is formed. Once this state is reached, the star dies and goes supernova because of the core shrinking, getting 
                hotter, until it collapses. It can then turn into a neutron star, or if the core is heavier, turn into a <em><a href="Black%20Holes.html">Black hole.</a></em></p>
